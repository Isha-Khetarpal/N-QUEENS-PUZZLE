# N-Queen Puzzle

-The N-Queens puzzle is about placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens can attack each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. To solve this puzzle, we use a method called recursion, where the solution is built step-by-step by placing one queen at a time and checking if it leads to a valid arrangement.
